# is-Replicant - An AI-Generated Text Detection API

## Introduction

The **is-Replicant** project aims to develop a FastAPI-based backend API for detecting AI-generated text. This system will analyze text inputs using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and return statistics and probabilities indicating the likelihood of the text being AI-generated. The project will utilize a PostgreSQL database, implement secure API design practices, and leverage several libraries and tools to ensure efficient and scalable implementation.
